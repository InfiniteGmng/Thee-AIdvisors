  "Nursing - About Our Programs": "Demand for highly qualified healthcare workers continues to grow within our region,\n                           state, nation and world. Green River College Nursing Programs offer a wide variety\n                           of health career training opportunities. Our nursing programs provide a comprehensive\n                           curriculum that includes study in theory and practical experience.\n\nYou can graduate in 3-6 months and be job-ready with our four certificate programs.\n                           We also offer a Practical Nursing Associates of Applied Science for both traditional\n                           students and Licensed Medical Assistants that prepares students for state licensing\n                           and qualify as an LPN. The Practical Nursing Program is offered in both full-time\n                           and part-time/hybrid formats. For licensed practical nurses, we offer a two-year hybrid\n                           BSN program that is designed for working nurses.\n\nStudents who plan to go straight to their Bachelors of Science in Nursing at a university,\n                           rather than pursue LPN first, should review the Pre-Nursing Transfer Degree.\n\n\n\nFor a tool that guides you through our nursing programs, check out our Green River College Nursing Guide.",
